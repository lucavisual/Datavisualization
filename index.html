				Introduction
			</h4>
			<section>
				The focus of our project concerns the analysis of some food parameters in African countries such as 
				price and scarcity. We decided to take this continent into consideration to visualize the nations where 
				the highest poverty is concentrated. The project is for informational purposes therefore the reference target 
				is very vast, even if there is a greater interest in reaching those people who have a strong will to bring 
				about a change, i.e.: volunteers or wealthier people interested in the works of charity. The goal of the 
				project is to show an overview of the price of food in the various nations of the continent by highlighting 
				the poorest nations in order to achieve global awareness.

					<h4>
						The problem of food distribution
					</h4>
					<p>
						According to an article in an Italian newspaper, there is no global shortage of food, but it is not 
						distributed fairly. The lack of food in Africa does not depend only on the war in Ukraine, but 
						began to manifest itself before this event and the conflict has only accentuated its effects.
						The problem is that at the moment there is no problem of global food shortage, but of access to food.
						The increase in prices, the instability of international markets, the strong dependence of some 
						countries on food imports represent a barrier to access to food and, ultimately, this depends on 
						the structural causes of hunger: conflicts, the climate crisis and the inequalities that expose the 
						most vulnerable groups to the devastating effects of economic shocks.
					</p>
					<p>
						With our visualization we want to show the African countries with the highest food prices so that we 
						can later analyze the reasons and act accordingly. An example of food prices that are too high could 
						be caused by the difficulty of transport, which if improved could guarantee a better quality of life 
						for many people. The purpose of our visualization, accompanied by appropriate analyses, is therefore to 
						select those countries that need immediate action.
